# Binary Search Project

This project implements a binary search algorithm using HTML and JavaScript. The application allows users to input the length of a vector and a target number, then displays the index of the target number within the vector.

## Features

- Accepts user input for the vector length and the target number.
- Converts the vector length into an array of sequential numbers.
- Implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the target number in the array.
- Displays the index of the target number or an appropriate error message if the target number is out of bounds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-search-project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd binary-search-project

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Usage
- Enter the desired vector length in the first input field.
- Enter the number whose position you want to know in the second input field.
- Click the "Submit" button.
- An alert will display the index of the number in the vector or an error message if the number is out of bounds.
